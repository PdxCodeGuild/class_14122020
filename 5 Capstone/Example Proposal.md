# Pryced - Capstone Proposal

## What is Pryced?
Pryced is the industry leading budget app for the common folk. Aimed at providing an easy way to track finances and budget for the future. 

## Project Overview
Pryced will allow users to upload a csv, then separate individual items into budget categories. The app is attempting to help users budget their finances more easily. I plan to use Django for the backend and Vue on the front end. I may look into a data visualization library for JS. 

## Functionality
- Allow the user upload a csv (most banks allow you to download a csv with all of your transactions.)
- Allow the user to sort transactions into budget categories.
- Allow the user to create categories and set a budget on them.
- Display budgets and spending on a dashboard

## Data Model
![Example DB](ExampleDB.jpg)
- Month (Used mainly for displaying the current month on the dashboard)
    - Month Name
